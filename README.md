# Collaborative Coding

This project is a web-based application for collaborative editing or coding.
It is intended for the Advanced Distributed Systems course I will be taking
next quarter (maybe just for fun if not applicable). I have always been thinking
of doing such a project, however a lot of things drag me from the desired track.
Finally, I decided to start it recently since I am now prepared with the necessary
tools and knowledge.

## Design Overview
To be updated.

## Implementation (tentative)
A similar project (not open-source), [collabedit](http://collabedit.com), is using
Tornado (Python) and jQuery (JavaScript) as its main back-end and front-end fuel.
I plan to use the same framework for back-end (since collaborative editing involves
quite amount of long-polling jobs), but to use Bootstrap, Backbone.js (Ember.js) and other modern
front-end frameworks to enhance user experience.

**Note**: Node.js is another alternative for its back-end, mainly because I would like
to learn deeper in JavaScript. Also, for JavaScript, it could be written first in CoffeeScript
and then get translated.

## Status
Not yet started.
