# Collaborative Coding

This project is a web-based application for collaborative editing or coding.
It is intended for the Advanced Distributed Systems course I will be taking
next quarter (maybe just for fun if not applicable). I have always been thinking
of doing such a project, however a lot of things drag me from the desired track.
Finally, I decided to start it recently since I am now prepared with the necessary
tools and knowledge.

## Design Overview
To be updated.

## Implementation (tentative)
A similar project (not open-source), [collabedit](http://collabedit.com), is using
Tornado (Python) and jQuery (JavaScript) as its main back-end and front-end fuel.
For me, I plan to use Node.js (express, socket.io) as back end, React.js and socket.io as
front end.

## Status
Not yet started.

## Contributors
Susen Zhao ([@susutou](https://github.com/susutou)), and will be more.
