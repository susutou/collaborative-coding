# Collaborative Coding

This project is a web-based application for collaborative editing or coding.
It is intended for the Advanced Distributed Systems course I will be taking
next quarter (maybe just for fun if not applicable). I have always thinking
of doing a project like this, however a lot of things drag me from the desired track.
Anyway, I decided to do it now since most tools required are just out there
for me.

## Design
To be updated.

## Implementation (tentative)
A similar project (not open-source), [collabedit](http://collabedit.com), is using
Tornado (Python) and jQuery (JavaScript) as its main back-end and front-end fuel.
I plan to use the same framework for back-end (since collaborative editing involves
quite amount of long-polling jobs), but to use Bootstrap, Backbone.js and other modern
front-end frameworks to enhance user experience.

## Status
Not yes started.

## Contributors
Susen Zhao (@susutou), and will be more.
